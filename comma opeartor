In JavaScript, the comma operator , is used to evaluate multiple expressions and return the value of the last expression. 
It evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the rightmost operand. The comma operator is most commonly used in variable declarations, 
for loop initializations, function arguments, and in expressions where multiple values need to be combined into a single expression.
